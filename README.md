# Project 3: From Portland to Portland

## Description
A responsive one page website about travelling. It was built in HTML5 & CSS.
Both flexbox and the CSS grid were used for the layout.

## Possible Improvements
- Some parts that are currently layed out with flexbox might work better with grid.
- Figure out some issues with spacing between paragraphs in the places section (small deviations from the common 25px bottom margin). This could be an intentional design choice, but it could also be a designer mistake.
